Welcome to the Experiment \n\n Click the mouse to begin...
On each trial you will hear a long sequence of sounds that are located in \n different areas of space.\n\n You must decide whether the sounds in the sequence are drawn from a normal spatial \n distribution with a mean that is either to the left or right of mid-point. \n\n You are to respond as accurately AND as fast as possible using the keys provided.\n\n You do not need to listen to the entire sound sequence before responding and \n should do so as soon as you have an answer. If you have not responded \n within 10 seconds the next trial will begin. \n\n Click to continue...
To help you, you will receive visual feedback as soon as you respond. This will be \n in the form of a green (correct) or red (incorrect) dot that will appear on-screen. \n\n You will also hear two high-pitched tones at the start of each trial that are \n centrally located. These are accompanied by a white dot on-screen which \n acts as a reference for the decision.\n\n Click to continue...
Lets begin with a practice session: \n\n Remember - You must decide whether the sounds in the sequence are \n drawn from a normal spatial distribution with a mean that is located \n either to the left or right of mid-point. \n\n It is important that you respond as soon as you have an answer. \n\n On each trial keep your index finger on the middle key "5" until you respond. \n You then respond by pressing the key that is above or below. \n\n You press UP for Right and DOWN for Left as soon as you have an answer.\n\n Click the mouse to have a go...
You will now do a configuration session. \n\n The session starts off very easy and get progressively harder as you progress. \n\n Do not worry if at any point you find the task too hard. Just focus on trying to \n  respond as accurately and as fast as possible. \n\n The session lasts ~ 6 mins and will end once enough data has been collected.\n\n Click to continue...
Remember - You must decide whether the sounds in the sequence are drawn from \n a normal spatial distribution with a mean that is located \n either to the left or right of mid-point. \n\n You are to respond by pressing either up (right) or down (left) from a resting position of key "5". \n You do not need to listen to the entire sound sequence before responding and \n should do so as soon as you have an answer. \n\n Click the mouse to begin...
End of the configuration session. \n\n Take a short break.
We will now start the main experimental session.\n\n It consists of 8 blocks of trials, each lasting ~ 6 minutes. \n\n After each block you will be given the chance to take a short pause. \n\n Click to continue...

You are halfway through the experiment.\n\n Take a break. \n\n It is ok to take your headphones off now. \n\n Click the mouse to continue when you are ready...
